Circadian stabilizer											(period circadian clock 3) help encode circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. Polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to sleep disorders (R).It's better to have this gene increased most of the time. Originally described as a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1, NR1D2, RORA, RORB and RORG, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Has a redundant role with the other PER proteins PER1 and PER2 and is not essential for the circadian rhythms maintenance. In contrast, plays an important role in sleep-wake timing and sleep homeostasis probably through the transcriptional regulation of sleep homeostasis-related genes, without influencing circadian parameters. Can bind heme.

Circadian and mood disorders											As with a symphony orchestra, the circadian orchestra is hierarchically organized, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of hypothalamus as its conductor. Circadian rhythm is generated by a transcriptional–translational feedback loop between two groups of clock genes: positive and negative elements. The circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and the brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (BMAL1), acting as positive elements, are responsible of the synthesis of two transcriptional factors, which after heterodimerization induce the expression of negative components of the molecular circadian clock such as periods (Pers 1, 2 and 3), cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 (REV-ERB-?). These negative elements, after dimerization (PER–CRY) undergo a nuclear translocation and act as suppressors of CLOCK and BMAL1 expression. Thus, the levels of positive and negative elements oscillate in antiphase with a period of approximately 24 h in SCN in vitro.Some components of the molecular clock, such as REV-ERB-?, BMAL1 and CLOCK also induce a number of extra-clock genes, termed clock-controlled genes (CCG), which are not directly involved in the clock machinery but are able to induce the expression of many target genes.

Promotes wakefulness, stabilises wakefulness and sleep											 Orexin seems to promote wakefulness. Recent studies indicate that a major role of the orexin system is to integrate metabolic, circadian andsleep debt influences to determine whether an animal should be asleep or awake and active. Orexin neurons strongly excite various brain nuclei with important roles in wakefulness including the dopamine,  norepinephrine, histamine and acetylcholine systems[18][19] and appear  to play an important role in stabilizing wakefulness and sleep.

	Longer sleep duration			Shorter sleep duration							Rs10766071 is a SNP in aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL). Rs10766071 has been associated with shorter sleep duration as measured by polysomnography— a method for recording the activity of the brain, eyes, muscles, and heart while the subject sleeps. The A allele (major allele) is associated with higher sleep duration and the G allele (minor allele) is associated with shorter sleep duration (n=414). However, only one individual with the GG genotype was in the study. G is the ancestral allele and is also the minor variant (frequency = .0851) (dbSNP).ARNTL encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS domain transcription factor (PMID:11163178).Studies have shown that ARNTL is an important component of the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) which regulates circadian rhythms. Homozygous ARNTL null mutant mice loose circadian rhythmicity, as measured by activity patterns, when transferred to constant darkness, demonstrating that ARNTL plays a key role in maintaining circadian rhythmicity (PMID:11163178).Rs1076671 was one of 13 significant SNPs (after Bonferroni correction) discovered by Kripke et al. (PMID:25660813) to be associated with sleep variables. Their study consisted of a cohort of patients of likely European ancestry who were recruited from a “busy academic sleep practice.” Patients consisted mostly of individuals who had been given a tentative diagnosis of sleep apnea, and had been sent for a polysomnography to confirm. All patients were 21 years or older.The authors of the paper collected DNA samples from the patients and then performed custom Illumina golden gate assay for 768 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This subset of SNPs was chosen because they were relevant to circadian rhythm regulation. Patients were surveyed about their sleep schedule and habits and polysomnographs were recorded of each patient. Thirty-eight phenotypic measures were analyzed. The authors performed linear or logistic regression analyses and then performed a Bonferroni correction for the total number of SNPs tested. The p-value for this association was 5.3x10-5 prior to Bonferroni correction. Importantly, this SNP is not genome-wide significant.References:Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP).

					Shorter sleep latency						When they initially developed the MSLT, Dement and others put subjects in a quiet, dark room with a bed and asked them to lie down, close their eyes and relax. They noted the number of minutes, ranging from 0 to 20, that it took a subject to fall asleep. If a volunteer was still awake after 20 minutes, the experiment was ended and the subject given a maximal alertness/minimal sleepiness rating. When scientists deprived subjects of sleep, they found sleep latency levels could drop below 1, i.e., subjects could fall asleep in less than a minute.

	Shorter sleep latency										When they initially developed the MSLT, Dement and others put subjects in a quiet, dark room with a bed and asked them to lie down, close their eyes and relax. They noted the number of minutes, ranging from 0 to 20, that it took a subject to fall asleep. If a volunteer was still awake after 20 minutes, the experiment was ended and the subject given a maximal alertness/minimal sleepiness rating. When scientists deprived subjects of sleep, they found sleep latency levels could drop below 1, i.e., subjects could fall asleep in less than a minute. The amount of sleep loss was directly linked to changes in sleep latency scores.[4]		rs185934952	A	Sleep Latency 					
Circadian											As with a symphony orchestra, the circadian orchestra is hierarchically organized, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of hypothalamus as its conductor. Circadian rhythm is generated by a transcriptional–translational feedback loop between two groups of clock genes: positive and negative elements. The circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and the brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (BMAL1), acting as positive elements, are responsible of the synthesis of two transcriptional factors, which after heterodimerization induce the expression of negative components of the molecular circadian clock such as periods (Pers 1, 2 and 3), cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 (REV-ERB-?). These negative elements, after dimerization (PER–CRY) undergo a nuclear translocation and act as suppressors of CLOCK and BMAL1 expression. Thus, the levels of positive and negative elements oscillate in antiphase with a period of approximately 24 h in SCN in vitro.Some components of the molecular clock, such as REV-ERB-?, BMAL1 and CLOCK also induce a number of extra-clock genes, termed clock-controlled genes (CCG), which are not directly involved in the clock machinery but are able to induce the expression of many target genes.

Circadian											(period circadian clock 3) help encode circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. Polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to sleep disorders (R).It's better to have this gene increased most of the time. Originally described as a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1, NR1D2, RORA, RORB and RORG, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Has a redundant role with the other PER proteins PER1 and PER2 and is not essential for the circadian rhythms maintenance. In contrast, plays an important role in sleep-wake timing and sleep homeostasis probably through the transcriptional regulation of sleep homeostasis-related genes, without influencing circadian parameters. Can bind heme.	PER3	RS228682		Circadian	CC	GG	GG

								Circadian and alcoholism			Effects of the circadian rhythm gene period 1 (per1) on psychosocial stress-induced alcohol drinking. (2011) [1] Circadian and stress-response systems mediate environmental changes that affect alcohol drinking. Psychosocial stress is an environmental risk factor for alcohol abuse. Circadian rhythm gene period 1 (Per1) is targeted by stress hormones and is transcriptionally activated in corticotropin releasing factor-expressing cells. mPer1-mutant mice showed enhanced alcohol consumption in response to social defeat stress relative to their wild-type littermates. An association with the frequency of heavy drinking in adolescents with the hPer1 promoter SNP rs3027172 and with psychosocial adversity was found. There was significant interaction between the rs3027172 genotype and psychosocial adversity on this drinking measure. Association of hPer1 rs3027172 with alcohol dependence was shown. Cortisol-induced transcriptional activation of hPer1 was reduced in human B-lymphoblastoid cells carrying the risk genotype of rs3027172. Binding affinity of the transcription factor Snail1 to the risk allele of the hPer1 SNP rs3027172 was also reduced. The findings indicate that the hPer1 gene regulates alcohol drinking behavior during stressful conditions and provide evidence for underlying neurobiological mechanisms. 		rs3027172	CC	Circadian and Alchoholism

			Increased obesity risk			increased obesity risk					As with a symphony orchestra, the circadian orchestra is hierarchically organized, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of hypothalamus as its conductor. Circadian rhythm is generated by a transcriptional–translational feedback loop between two groups of clock genes: positive and negative elements. The circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and the brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (BMAL1), acting as positive elements, are responsible of the synthesis of two transcriptional factors, which after heterodimerization induce the expression of negative components of the molecular circadian clock such as periods (Pers 1, 2 and 3), cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 (REV-ERB-?). These negative elements, after dimerization (PER–CRY) undergo a nuclear translocation and act as suppressors of CLOCK and BMAL1 expression. Thus, the levels of positive and negative elements oscillate in antiphase with a period of approximately 24 h in SCN in vitro.Some components of the molecular clock, such as REV-ERB-?, BMAL1 and CLOCK also induce a number of extra-clock genes, termed clock-controlled genes (CCG), which are not directly involved in the clock machinery but are able to induce the expression of many target genes.

									Narcolepsy		Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder with excessive daytime sleepiness as the main symptom. About 1 in 2,000 people in the United States has narcolepsy with cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone upon experiencing certain emotions that may cause the person to collapse. Other common symptoms include sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations upon falling asleep or waking up.Wikipedia	CPT1B-CHKB	rs5770917	C;T	Narcolepsy	TT
